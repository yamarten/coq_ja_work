"The |Coq| system is designed to develop mathematical proofs, and especially "
"to write formal specifications, programs and to verify that programs are "
"correct with respect to their specifications. It provides a specification "
"language named |Gallina|. Terms of |Gallina| can represent programs as well "
"as properties of these programs and proofs of these properties. Using the so-"
"called *Curry-Howard isomorphism*, programs, properties and proofs are "
"formalized in the same language called *Calculus of Inductive "
"Constructions*, that is a :math:`\\lambda`-calculus with a rich type system. "
"All logical judgments in |Coq| are typing judgments. The very heart of the |"
"Coq| system is the type checking algorithm that checks the correctness of "
"proofs, in other words that checks that a program complies to its "
"specification. |Coq| also provides an interactive proof assistant to build "
"proofs using specific programs called *tactics*."

"In interactive mode, users can develop their theories and proofs step by "

"documented in :ref:`coqintegrateddevelopmentenvironment`, Emacs with Proof-"
"General :cite:`Asp00` [#PG]_, or jsCoq to run Coq in your browser (see "
"https://github.com/ejgallego/jscoq). The `coqtop` read-eval-print-loop can "
"also be used directly, for debugging purposes."

"The first part describes the specification language, |Gallina|. Chapters :"

"in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions. Chapter :ref:`thecoqlibrary` "

"The second part describes the proof engine. It is divided in six chapters. "
"Chapter :ref:`vernacularcommands` presents all commands (we call them "
"*vernacular commands*) that are not directly related to interactive proving: "
"requests to the environment, complete or partial evaluation, loading and "
"compiling files. How to start and stop proofs, do multiple proofs in "
"parallel is explained in Chapter :ref:`proofhandling`. In Chapter :ref:"
"`tactics`, all commands that realize one or more steps of the proof are "
"presented: we call them *tactics*. The language to combine these tactics "
"into complex proof strategies is given in Chapter :ref:`ltac`. Examples of "
"tactics are described in Chapter :ref:`detailedexamplesoftactics`. Finally, "
"the |SSR| proof language is presented in Chapter :ref:"
"`thessreflectprooflanguage`."
